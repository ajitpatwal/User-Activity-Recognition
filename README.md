In this spark project, real-time data collection and aggregation from a simulated real-time system is being done.



The dataset for the project which will simulate our sensor data delivery which is obtained from Microsoft Research Asia GeoLife project. According to the paper, the dataset recorded a broad range of usersâ€™ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shoping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.

As a part of this big data project, we will use the data to provide real time aggregation of the movements along a number of dimension like effective distance, duration, trajectories and more. All streamed data will be stored in the NoSQL database - HBase.
